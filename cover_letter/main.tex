I am writing to you regarding the **** position at ****. I found your posting on **** and was instantly attracted to the opportunities offered by this job. ****'s reputation for responsive service and proactive support differentiates your company from the rest, and I would like to be part of your dynamic team.

I am a conscientious and high-achieving Master of Computer Science degree holder majoring in Artificial Intelligence. I have exceptional technical and analytical skills, with experience in software development, web development, database management, network and server support, program configuration, testing and evaluation, algorithm design, data analysis, which I have gained in study/research and various programmer roles. 

I first started my IT related working experience back at Tianjin University as the project leader of the university's website studio which is the top class university web studio in China. Then I was recommended by the studio to enter Baidu Inc., which is one of the largest internet companies in China, as intern programmer. Experiences in Baidu were invaluable in allowing me to open my eyes to the creative challenges required in the industry and develop/apply my skills in a professional context. I rapidly adapted to the new work culture and team members who became trusted associates throughout my time spent there.

In Canada during the graduate study, I have gained further experience aside from my research, through the Mitacs internship program for Clean Energy Consulting Inc. and Goldstream Publishing Inc. in Prince George. One of them is developing a text mining application which is an automated text mining algorithm to extract location-based information from online documents. Another is an automatic inventory control system used by heat power station to monitor and predict the transport and inventory status of fuel.

You will find me to be a positive, motivated, and hard-working person who is keen to learn and contribute. My technical skills are combined with excellent communication skills that allow me to work effectively and positively and get along well with others.

I am eager to pursue a successful career in IT, and the **** position is perfectly aligned with my skills and interests. I believe that I have the right skills and experience to be a great fit for this position. My resume is attached and I look forward to being able to discuss the position with you further.
